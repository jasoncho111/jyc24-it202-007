<tr><td> <em>Sub-Task 2: </em> Explain what data you'll be using from the API and how you plan to use it in the project</td></tr>
<tr><td> <em>Response:</em> <p>The API allows you to pull data about different countries. You can pull<br>the data by country name, by region, etc. Right now, I don&#39;t know<br>how exactly I want to use the data, but since the data will<br>have to be associated with a user, I figured that I can just<br>associate each user to a country, and that each user would then have<br>additional country information associated with them, such as default language. Right now, it<br>looks like the best endpoint to use would be the &quot;search countries by<br>name&quot;.<br></p><br></td></tr>
<tr><td> <em>Sub-Task 3: </em> API Info</td></tr>
<tr><td> <em>Response:</em> <p>The API allows 1000 requests per month as a hard limit. Additionally, you<br>can only make 5 requests per second<br></p><br></td></tr>

<tr><td> <em>Response:</em> <p>I&#39;ve worked on discord bots before, so I have used the discord API.<br>I have never created an API myself. I was thinking of using an<br>API for some video games, but I wasn&#39;t sure how that would fit<br>into the scope of the project for this class.<br></p><br></td></tr>
